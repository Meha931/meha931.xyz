        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Here you can find general information about this website and me.
        </p>

        <h2>The me</h2>
        <p>
            I don't usually like to tell about myself (probably because
            I don't know what to say).
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to program, sometimes on JS, but lately usually on C.
            Am not very skilled in either, just enough to use them in small
            projects. Some of the best are
            <a href="https://meha931.github.io/minesweeper">Minesweeper</a> and
            <a href="https://meha931.github.io/snake">Snake</a> games.
        </p>
        <p>
            And of course, I do like playing games, but I try not to spend too
            much time in them <s>though I often do</s>.
            Some of my achievements (in games in general) include the completed P5
            in Hollow Knight and quite a few played mods for Portal.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for the other hobbies...
            <br>
            I used to draw sometimes, but I do it very rarely. I don't think there
            are any good drawings that I can show (Seriously, I don't draw much,
            and last time I published anything I wasn't as good as now, so it would
            be appreciated if you won't ask for them, at least now).
            <br>
            I also study languages sometimes, though I wouldn't like to tell about
            these publicly. Let's just consider me to know about 3.5 in total :p
        </p>
        <p><small><small><small>
            oh this all was difficult for me to write
            <br>
            how talk good

            You can usually find me with the "Meha931" name/tag on
            most places. I don't think there are many impersonators
            of me, but it's certainly taken by me on Steam and Github.
        </p>
        <p>
            You also <s>can</s> could send me an emаil
            a while ago, but at the moment the mail server is down.
            It was quite a problem to set it up, so it's not very likely that
            it'll be available again anytime soon.

            - yes, this is a valid inbox that I check whenever I log in as that user.
            I won't be able to reply though, at least not to addresses on popular
            services - their security systems are so good that my messages won't
            even reach the spam folder. -->
        </p>
        <p>
            I might also install a Matrix server sometime, but I failed to set one up
            on the first try, so it might take a while.

        <h2>The tools</h2>
        <p>
            Since I moved to Linux, I now mostly use open-source software.
            <br>
            Which sometimes is quite difficult to use because it's never fully
            compatible with commonly used "regular" software, and sometimes it
            just doesn't work properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, Linux allows quite a lot of things to be customized.
            It takes some experience, but the end result is very satisfying.
        </p>
        <p>
            So here are some (hard-/software) tools that I use:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Arch Linux <s>btw</s> with Sway WM and some programs from Gnome - workspace;
            </li>
            <li>
                LibreOffice, GNU Octave, Qucs-S, VSC (OSS) - studying;
            </li>
            <li>
                OBS Studio, Blender, ffmpeg (or HandBrake if it fails), GIMP, Krita -
                video and image editing;
            </li>
            <li>
                Firefox, Discord, Steam, Telegram - browsing and communication.
            </li>
        </ul>
        -->

        <h2>The site</h2>
        <p>
            Here's some technical info about the site:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Hosted on a VPS that costs about <s>$1</s> <s>$3</s> $5/month - now it has
                <s>0.5</s> <s>2</s> 4 GB of RAM, which should be enough for some games.
                I also use it as a VPN sometimes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Requests to this server are routed by Nginx. Most files
                are served by it too, but .ejs ones are handled by Node with
                some plugins.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's Encrypt certificates, <s>updated manually because I still
                don't really trust Certbot to edit my fragile Nginx config</s>
                Last time I used Certbot, it somehow set up some timer to update
                the certificate automatically. I really doubt that it works
                though.
            </li>
            <li>
                Views and other data that's not possible on a static page
                is handled by the same server too. That was actually the reason
                why I decided to host the website on a server, though I might
                switch to third parties sometime.
            </li>
            <li>
                <s>The website's protected by Cloudflare. Although I have no clear idea of
                how it does the protection, because I still get a lot of strange
                requests.</s>
                <br>
                It's not exactly useful, and having unproxied domain name simply makes it
                more accessible <del>and just a little bit more vulnerable</del>.
            </li>
            <li>
                And the domain registrar... well, you can just do a Whois lookup &#128517;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <s>Just don't attack the server please</s>
