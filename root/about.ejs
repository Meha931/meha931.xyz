        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            I don't usually like to tell about myself (probably because
            I don't know what to say).
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to program, sometimes on JS, but lately usually on C.
            Am not very skilled in either, just enough to use them in small
            projects. Some of the best are
            <a href="https://meha931.github.io/minesweeper">Minesweeper</a> and
            <a href="https://meha931.github.io/snake">Snake</a> games.
        </p>
        <p>
            And of course, I do like playing games, but I try not to spend too
            much time in them <s>though I often do</s>.
            Some of my achievements (in games in general) include the completed P5
            in Hollow Knight and quite a few played mods for Portal.
        </p>

            As for the other hobbies...
            <br>
            I used to draw sometimes, but I do it very rarely. I don't think there
            are any good drawings that I can show (Seriously, I don't draw much,
            and last time I published anything I wasn't as good as now, so it would
            be appreciated if you won't ask for them, at least now).
            <br>
            I also learn languages sometimes, though I wouldn't like to tell about
            these publicly. Let's just consider me to know about 3.5 in total :p
        </p>

            You can usually find me with the "Meha931" name/tag on
            most places. I don't think there are many impersonators
            of me, but it's certainly taken by me on Steam and Github.
